# Integrated Project

This is the Integrated Project part of the Web Software Construction course, where we developed an application idea for the management and validation of complementary activities. I transformed some of the screens designed by my colleagues in Figma during the User Interface Experience course into HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
